		<h3> Weekly Woman in Tech: ISIS SHIFFER</h3>
 	<p> Isis is an industrial design engineer who has taken the tech world by storm. She has applied her passion for simple, yet innovative, design to an everyday use in the cycling industry.
	 She was the international winner of the 2016 James Dyson Award for her <a href="http://www.ecohelmet.com">EcoHelmet</a> - a disposable and cheap helmet made from waterproof recycled paper.
	 It aimed to target the market for share bike users, to increase safety for all cyclists. Although made from paper, the honeycomb radial patter provides significant protection from impact in all directions and
	 it folds flat for easy storage after use. She has spent much of her professional life acting as a design consultant for companies such as Ford UK, or the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, NYC.
	 In 2016 she founded her own company, Spitfire Industry, where she can continue to develop products related to her favourite hobbies and interests. </p>
